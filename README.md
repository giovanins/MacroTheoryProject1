# Macro Theory Project 1

This is the R code for Macro Thoery Project 1. This project analyzes GDP per capita growth rates for three countries: The United Kingdeom, The Republic of Korea, and Madagascar. 
The project uses visualisation and statitsical analysis to examine economic trends and relattionships between key indicators. 


##  Part 1:
### Requirments
These are the following packages that need to be installed before running the script:
- dyplr
- stargazer
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- corrplot
- GGally

## Part 2
### Analysis of GDP Growth

1. Seperate data by country
2. Create a GDP Growth rate for each
3. Seperate out year and Growth Rates into a seperate data table, using only the first 50 lines
4. Create a table to compare data
5. Plot all 3 countries on a 1 line plot to compare

## Part 3

### UK GDP Growth Trends

1. Using UK as a single country, subset data in different time groups, calculating the average GDP growth per period
2. Plot that data on a seperate graph
3. Filter data to remove missing values and visualize a correlation matrix
4. Create a scatterplot analysis to compare GDP Growth rate to other economic indicators
5. Using ggpairs to generate a scatter plot matrix for more insight
