# Macro Theory Project 1

This is the R code for Macro Theory Project 1. This project analyzes GDP per capita growth rates for three countries: the United Kingdom, the Republic of Korea, and Madagascar.
The project uses visualization and statistical analysis to examine economic trends and relationships between key indicators.


##  Part 1:
### Requirments
The following packages need to be installed before running the script:
- dyplr
- stargazer
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- corrplot
- GGally

## Part 2
### Analysis of GDP Growth

1. Seperate data by country
2. Create a GDP growth rate for each country.
3. Separate year and growth rates into a separate data table, using only the first 50 rows.
4. Create a table to compare data.
5. Plot all three countries on a single line plot for comparison.


## Part 3

### UK GDP Growth Trends

1. Using the UK as a single country, subset data into different time periods and calculate the average GDP growth per period.
2. Plot the data on a separate graph
3. Filter data to remove missing values and visualize a correlation matrix.
4. Create a scatterplot analysis to compare GDP growth rates with other economic indicators.
5. Use ggpairs to generate a scatterplot matrix for deeper insights.
